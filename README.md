# Studio Ghibli Film Catalogue
This is a catalogue of all Studio Ghibli films, built with React and Redux. On the Home Page, users can see a list of Studio Ghibli films with a corresponding movie poster, title, rating, and year of release. Upon clicking one of these film cards, users can then see more details about their chosen film (full description, director, proudcer, rating, and year of release). Users can also search for a specific title, or can sort by title, rating, oldest to newest, or newest to oldest.

For Film Details, this project uses a [Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/).
For Film Posters, it uses the [IMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/).
